# Airbnb_MachineLearning

The purpose of the project was to use Frequent Pattern Mining algorithm to find associations between items in the dataset. 
<br><br>
We used different algorithms within Frequent Pattern Mining like Apriori, Association Rules, and Frequent-Pattern Growth, from different packages like ML-Xtend and Spark packages. The model identified the itemsets that are regular/popular amongst the Airbnb dataset. We found that there are amenities that are regular across all Airbnb, however, to receive high amount of reviews and to achieve high review scores for an Airbnb, the algorithm found that additional amenities should be provided, and they should be provided as a bundle. We also found that while laptop friendly workspace is more popular in the west coast, air-conditioning is more popular in the east coast.
